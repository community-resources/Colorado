## Aggregated Resource Directories
_Search for food, shelter, medical care, job training, and more in one place._

For the most comprehensive support, **check both your specific county AND the statewide resources.**
Local county pages are often superior for finding "immediate-need" resources like **emergency eviction legal aid, local clothing closets, transit vouchers, childcare subsidies, and more.** If a local page is missing a specific category, the statewide search engines below aggregate thousands of **broader assistance resources** that cover the entire state.

### County Resource Directories
**Start here for localized aid.**

These directories often include specialized support that may not appear in larger databases. Includes food pantries, clothing, and much more
